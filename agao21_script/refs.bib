For sparse graphs with polynomially bounded integer capacities, this is the first improvement over the \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(m\^\{1.5\} \textbackslash log U)\$ time bound from [Goldberg-Rao JACM `98]. Our algorithm revolves around dynamically maintaining the augmenting electrical flows at the core of the interior point method based algorithm from [M\textbackslash k\{a\}dry JACM `16]. This entails designing data structures that, in limited settings, return edges with large electric energy in a graph undergoing resistance updates.},
